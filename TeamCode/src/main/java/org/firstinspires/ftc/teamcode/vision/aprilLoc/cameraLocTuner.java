    //TODO: write a class that instructs the user to perform the following tasks in order to get
    // the current position of the camera:
        //1: during init: have the person put an apriltag on the floor, left wall, and far wall all in the robots field of view.
        //then have them start the opmode which localizes to each individual apriltag(remember -1 allows
        //any apriltag to be called). it should print the highest value for each(the apriltag on the far wall and floor
        //should be align with the camera)

        //output should  be:
            //camera x offset: Math.abs(144-apriltag.x)
            //camera y: apriltag.y
            //camera z: apriltag.z
            //camera offset:
